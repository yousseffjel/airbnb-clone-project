### 🧠 Importance of Identifying Design Properties from a Mockup

Understanding and extracting design properties from a Figma mockup is critical for:

- **Design Consistency**: Ensures that colors, fonts, and spacing are uniform across all pages.
- **Efficient Development**: Developers can directly translate the design into code without ambiguity.
- **Collaboration**: Designers and developers speak a common visual language, reducing miscommunication.
- **User Experience**: A polished, consistent UI builds user trust and makes interactions smoother.
- **Scalability**: A defined design system simplifies the process of adding new features or pages later.

Properly identifying these visual specifications helps maintain a high-quality and professional user interface throughout the project.
